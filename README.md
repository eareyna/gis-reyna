# gis-reyna

My name is Edgar Reyna, I am currently in Tepic, Nayarit, doing my summer internship on regional climate adaptation with WWF and UNDP. I am attempting to learn GIS on my own, through Yoh's old course materials since I am going into my second year of the MURP program and want to build a deeper analytical skillset for climate change adaptation measures. 

Last time I used ArcGIS was in 2012, but I don't remember most of what I learned then. Now I am hoping to find some useful climate data sets that I can work through this summer to learn how to work with climate data via GIS.
